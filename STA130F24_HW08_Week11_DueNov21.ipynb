There are differences of course, such as how there is **coefficient hypothesis testing** in **multiple linear regression** and **confusion matrices** in **classification decision trees**, and so on. But you would very likely be able to leverage the silarities to make a lot of progress with **classification decision trees** based on your experience with **multiple linear regression**.\n",

Thus overall \"criterion\" noted above improves with each new **decision node splitting rule**, so the improvement can thus be tracked and the improvement contributions attributed to the **feature** upon which the **decision node splitting rule** is based.

But the so-called **feature importance** heuristics allows us to judge how relatively important the overall contributions from different features are in the final decision tree predictions.

Fortunately, the \"GridSearchCV\" methodology mentioned in regards to finding the best `max_depth` setting for a tree is going to provide a general answer to the challenge of complexity and **overfitting** in **machine learning models** that is not too hard to understand (and which you might already have some guesses or a hunch about). \n",
